Hello my name is Siddhant.
and apps to that class is used to show code between different subclasses and an interface is used to serve as a wrapper to different classes with the same function definitions

an interface is uh evaporator all classes that implement it they have they share the same function definition
makes use of the last in first out ordering while the queue makes use of the first and first out order
