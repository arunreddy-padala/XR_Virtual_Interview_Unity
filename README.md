1. Designed an application that focuses on how VR applications can be used to simulate technical interviews for training students in Computer Science (CS) to land a good technical job. 
2. The VR application allows participants to train for 3 technical roles, namely, Software Development Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and AR/VR Engineer. 
3. The participant can choose from a male or female interviewer (3D avatar) and customise their skin color to make make the interview experience more comfortable.
4. The participant themselves is represented in the app as a pair of hands (3D hand model) in the skin color of their choice.
5. The interview proceeds with the interviewer asking 4 technical questions. For each question, an audio response is recorded from the participant. The response is scored and a feedback is presented to the user at the end.
6. The application includes an survey scene at the end where participants answer questions related to the application. 
7. The app uses Azure’s Speech to Text API for transcribing the participant’s response. It uses OpenAI’s large language model, GPT-3, to provide a feedback for the participant’s response.
8. The app was user tested by 30 CS students. The app was found to be useful and easy to use. It did not upset participants or cause significant anxiety. 
9. Overall, findings from the user survey data suggest that technical interview training VR apps could receive widespread adoption.
